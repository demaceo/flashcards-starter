## Overview & Learning Goals ::
For this Mod 2 solo project, FlashCards, I had been given a repository with provided logic and a data set. The intended goal was to create an application to be used in terminal with operational functionality according to the rubric and provided composition.
My goals for this project were to brush-up on and utilize concepts from Mod 1, as well as gather a better understanding of mocha and chai.

## How to Play ::
- Clone this repository to personal computer.
- In Terminal, `cd` into this cloned repo.
- Run `npm install` in Terminal.
- Type `node index.js` into the Terminal.
- Here, one by one, a series of questions will be displayed in Terminal.
- Each question will have **three** answers to choose from.
- Enter the corresponding number (`1`, `2`, or `3`) to answer the question.
- Submit the answer by clicking the `return` key.
- As a result, Terminal will log whether or not the answer was correct.
- Click `return` key again to have another question be displayed.

## App in Action ::
