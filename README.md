## Overview & Learning Goals ::
For this Mod 2 solo project, FlashCards, I had been given a repository with provided logic and a data set. The intended goal was to create an application to be used in terminal with operational functionality according to the rubric and provided composition.
My goals for this project were to brush-up on and utilize concepts from Mod 1, as well as gather a better understanding of mocha and chai.

## How to Play ::
- Clone this repository to personal computer.
- In Terminal, `cd` into the cloned repo,
- Run `npm install`,
- Type `node index.js`.
- Here, one by one, a series of questions will begin to be displayed in the Terminal.
- Each question will have **three** answers to choose from.
- To submit a guess to a question, enter a corresponding number (`1`, `2`, or `3`) to one of the three listed answers that have been logged.
- Submit the guess by clicking the `return` key.
- As a result, the Terminal will log whether or not the answer was correct.
- Click the `return` key again to have another question be displayed.
- At the end of the round, the console will log the percentage of correct answers that the user gave.
